/*
 This is a simple minesweeper program
 The program asks the user for the size of the board, and the ammount of mines.
 Every turn the user is asked for coordinate points of their move and if they want to toggle flag or reveal the position.
 Every turn a new board is printed to the screen with the results of the turn.
 If a mine is revealed it is game over.
 If all mines are flagged the game is won.
 The numbers on each position is the number of mines that position is directly adjacent to (in the 8 positions immediately surrounding it).
 
 For this program,
 - # represents a covered position
 - F represents a flagged position
 - M represents a position with a mine
 - _ represents "0".
 - 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 represent the number of mines next to the position.
 
 For rules and strategy refer to www.minesweeper.info/wiki/strategy
 
 GOOD LUCK!!
